#New Database Technologies to look into

1. [Fauna Db](https://faunadb.com/)

  A distributed database, in goes the JSON, and out come answers from a distributed collection of nodes. FaunaDBâ€™s query language 
  offers the ability to ask complex questions that join together data from different nodes while searching through social networks and other graph structures in your databases. 

  FaunaDB comes in a cloud database-as-a-service version. When and if you want to take more control, you can install the enterprise version on your own iron.

2. [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/)
  ArangoDB lets you stick data in documents or in a graph database. Then you can write queries that are really loops with joins 
  that run on the database with all of the locality that makes processing those queries faster. Oh, and the query language is 
  wrapped up in JavaScript that exposes microservices through a RESTful API. It's a kitchen-sink approach that's bound to
  make many people happy.
